### Hotel List Viewed Event

This event is sent when a user views a **list of hotels** returned by a search queryâ€”typically after entering a destination, dates, and number of guests.
It helps measure **destination-level interest**, understand **pricing exposure**, and optimize **search results ranking** based on guest behavior and hotel visibility.
