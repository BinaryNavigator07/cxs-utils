title: The Semantic Event Schema
---

# Introduction
The Extended Semantic Events Schema provides a powerful and highly extensible framework for capturing, structuring, and analyzing semantic business events. Building upon foundational event structures popularized by platforms like Segment.com, our schema enriches traditional semantic events with extensive contextual, analytical, and operational data, enabling organizations to achieve deep insights and highly autonomous analytics.

By integrating rich metadata, contextual details, user traits, advanced classification methods, sentiment analysis, and robust access control, this schema supports sophisticated use cases across diverse industries. Optimized for compatibility, scalability, and compliance (including GDPR), our Extended Semantic Events Schema is designed specifically for organizations leveraging real-time analytics, machine learning, and AI-driven decision-making through the Context Suite.
## Key features include:

- **Semantic Clarity:**\
Events are explicitly named and categorized, facilitating clear interpretation and analysis.

- **Comprehensive Identification:**\
Unified management of anonymous and identified users, sessions, entities, and transactional identifiers ensures robust tracking across all touchpoints.

- **Contextual Richness:**\
Nested structures capture in-depth context, including entity roles, product attributes, location data, and sentiment insights, enhancing predictive and analytical capabilities.

- **GDPR and Compliance:**\
Personally identifiable information (PII) is managed separately, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

- **Advanced Analytics Support:**\
Explicit classification, access control, and internal analysis metadata enable detailed insights and optimized resource management.

Designed with scalability and adaptability in mind, the Semantic Events Schema serves as a robust foundation for enterprises aiming to leverage real-time analytics and autonomous decision-making through contextual awareness and artificial intelligence.

## Core Schema Concepts

### Semantic Events
A Semantic Event is a record of an action or occurrence with well-defined meaning and context. It describes what happened and why, gaining its richness by detailing what **Entities** were involved and the specific **Datapoints** associated with the event and those entities. This design ensures events are understandable by both humans and machines. The primary purpose of a Semantic Event is to capture meaningful business activities in a structured and standardized way, allowing for consistent interpretation and analysis across different systems and teams.

### Entities
An Entity represents a distinct, identifiable actor or object involved in a Semantic Event. This could be, for example, a customer, a product, a service, or a system component. Each entity is typically characterized by a unique identifier and a set of attributes that describe its properties. The purpose of Entities is to contextualize events by clearly identifying the key actors or objects that participated in or were affected by the event. For a more detailed explanation, see [Entities](../../entities/index.md).

### Datapoints
A Datapoint is a specific piece of information, measurement, or attribute that provides granular details about an event or an entity. Examples include the price of a product, the duration of a user session, a customer rating, or a specific error code. Datapoints are the most granular level of information, and their purpose is to offer precise details that are essential for in-depth analysis, reporting, and triggering automated processes. For a more detailed explanation, see [Datapoints](../../datapoints/index.md).

These three core concepts—Semantic Events, Entities, and Datapoints—interrelate to provide a comprehensive and multi-dimensional view of business activities. A Semantic Event tells you what happened; the associated **Entities** identify who or what was involved; and the relevant **Datapoints** provide the specific, granular details and measurements related to the event and those entities. This structured approach ensures that data is not only captured but also imbued with meaning and context, making it highly valuable for analytics, operational decision-making, and automated systems.
