# Marketing Attribution (`campaign.*` fields)

The `campaign.*` prefixed properties in the Semantic Event Schema are designed to capture standard marketing attribution parameters associated with an event. These fields are crucial for understanding how marketing efforts contribute to user actions and for tracking the effectiveness of various campaigns and channels.

These properties closely correspond to the widely used **UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) parameters**, allowing for seamless integration with web analytics platforms and marketing campaign tracking systems.

## Campaign Attribution Properties

The following table details the standard `campaign.*` fields. These are conceptually optional as not every event will have associated campaign data.

| Name                | Required | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `campaign.campaign` |          | `String`  | The specific marketing campaign name (e.g., "Summer_Sale_2023", "Q4_Product_Launch"). Corresponds to `utm_campaign`. Originally `LowCardinality(String)`. This field is optional. |
| `campaign.source`   |          | `String`  | The referrer or source of the traffic (e.g., "google", "facebook", "newsletter_september", "internal_promo"). Corresponds to `utm_source`. Originally `LowCardinality(String)`. This field is optional. |
| `campaign.medium`   |          | `String`  | The marketing medium or channel (e.g., "cpc", "social_media", "email", "organic_search", "affiliate"). Corresponds to `utm_medium`. Originally `LowCardinality(String)`. This field is optional. |
| `campaign.term`     |          | `String`  | The paid keywords or specific search terms used for the campaign. Often used for paid search ads. Corresponds to `utm_term`. Originally `LowCardinality(String)`. This field is optional. |
| `campaign.content`  |          | `String`  | Used to differentiate ads or links that point to the same URL (e.g., "logolink", "textlink", "ad_variant_A"). Corresponds to `utm_content`. Originally `LowCardinality(String)`. This field is optional. |

## Understanding and Using Campaign Data

Campaign attribution fields are vital for marketers and analysts to measure the impact of their activities. By associating events (such as user sign-ups, product purchases, page views, or app installs) with these parameters, businesses can:

*   **Track Marketing ROI:** Determine which campaigns, sources, and mediums are driving valuable user actions and conversions.
*   **Optimize Ad Spend:** Identify high-performing keywords and ad content to allocate marketing budgets more effectively.
*   **Understand Customer Journeys:** Analyze how users arrive at their site or app and what marketing touchpoints they interacted with.
*   **Segment Audiences:** Group users based on the campaigns they responded to for targeted communication or analysis.

**Correspondence to UTM Parameters:**

As mentioned, these fields directly map to standard UTM parameters:
*   `campaign.campaign` -> `utm_campaign`
*   `campaign.source`   -> `utm_source`
*   `campaign.medium`   -> `utm_medium`
*   `campaign.term`     -> `utm_term`
*   `campaign.content`  -> `utm_content`

This standardization ensures that data collected via semantic events can be easily compared and integrated with data from other analytics tools that also use UTM tagging (like Google Analytics).

**Example:**

Hereâ€™s how these fields might appear in a "User Registered" event that originated from a paid Google search ad:

```json
{
  "event": "User Registered",
  "user_id": "usr_9a8b7c6d",
  "timestamp": "2023-11-15T10:30:00Z",
  // ... other event properties
  "campaign.campaign": "Holiday_Promo_2023",
  "campaign.source": "google",
  "campaign.medium": "cpc",
  "campaign.term": "buy_holiday_gifts_online",
  "campaign.content": "TextAd_VariantB_DiscountFocus",
  // ... other context fields
}
```

By consistently capturing these `campaign.*` properties, organizations can build a comprehensive picture of their marketing performance and its direct influence on key business events.
