# Event Processing & Pipeline Metadata

Once a semantic event is generated by a client application or source system and sent to a collection endpoint, it embarks on a journey through a data pipeline. During this journey, various processing steps occur, and metadata is often attached to the event. This metadata provides insights into the event's lifecycle, how it was handled, its relationship to other data, and operational details.

Understanding these processing concepts and associated metadata is crucial for data governance, debugging, performance monitoring, and comprehending the full context of your event data. This page provides a conceptual overview, linking to specific field definitions found elsewhere in the schema documentation.

## Event Reception & Timestamps

Capturing accurate timestamps is fundamental to event processing, allowing for correct sequencing, latency calculations, and understanding user behavior over time.
*   **Concept:** Several timestamps are often associated with an event: its original occurrence time, when it was sent from the client, and when it was received by the collection infrastructure. Local time might also be captured for context.
*   **Schema Details:** Fields like `original_timestamp`, `sent_at`, `received_at`, and `local_time` provide these crucial temporal details.
*   **Further Information:** See definitions in [Core Event Properties](./core.md).

## Unique Event Identification

To ensure traceability and prevent duplication, events are assigned unique identifiers as they move through the pipeline.
*   **Concept:** A client might generate an initial ID (`message_id`), and the server-side infrastructure might assign a global, canonical ID (`event_gid`) upon reception and processing.
*   **Schema Details:** `message_id` and `event_gid` are key for uniquely identifying each event instance.
*   **Further Information:** See definitions in [Core Event Properties](./core.md).

## Data Routing & Integrations Control

Events collected are often routed to multiple downstream destinations, such as analytics platforms, data warehouses, marketing automation tools, or real-time alerting systems.
*   **Concept:** The `integrations` field, typically a map structure, allows for fine-grained control on a per-event basis, specifying which downstream integrations should (or should not) receive that particular event, potentially overriding system-wide defaults.
*   **Schema Details:** The `integrations` map (e.g., `{"Segment": true, "Salesforce": false}`) dictates this routing.
*   **Further Information:** See the `integrations` field definition in [Core Event Properties](./core.md).

## Internal Analysis & Processing Details (Conceptual)

As events are processed, they may undergo various internal analyses or enrichments (e.g., by machine learning models). Metadata about this processing might be attached.
*   **Concept:** This could include details like the cost of processing (e.g., token usage for an LLM enrichment), versions of models used for classification or sentiment analysis, or risk scores. The `analysis` nested structure in `semantic_events.sql` is designed for such metadata.
*   **Schema Details:** For detailed field definitions within such a structure (if exposed to users).
*   **Further Information:** See `[Analysis & Processing Details](./analysis_metadata.md)` (placeholder for future detailed documentation).

## Derived & Higher-Order Events (Conceptual)

Some events are not directly generated by client interactions but are instead derived or synthesized from other events within the pipeline. These are often called higher-order events.
*   **Concept:** For example, a series of "Page Viewed" events might lead to a derived "Session Started" event, or an "Order Completed" event might trigger a fraud detection model that generates an "Order Flagged for Review" event. The `base_events` nested structure in `semantic_events.sql` is intended to link such derived events back to their originating events.
*   **Schema Details:** This structure would contain references to the `event_gid`s of the base events.
*   **Further Information:** See `[Derived Event Linkage](./base_events_metadata.md)` (placeholder for future detailed documentation).

## Storage & Lifecycle Management (Primarily Internal)

Certain metadata fields are crucial for the technical management of event data within the storage systems, handling aspects like data partitioning, retention, and write access.
*   **Concept:** Fields like `write_key` (an API key identifier), `ttl_days` (time-to-live), and `partition` (for distributing data in storage) play a vital role in the data platform's internal operations.
*   **Schema Details:** While primarily for internal use, these fields might be visible to users directly querying the raw event data stores.
*   **Further Information:** See definitions for `write_key`, `ttl_days`, `partition` in [Core Event Properties](./core.md).

By understanding these aspects of event processing and the associated metadata, users can gain a more comprehensive view of their data's journey and context, leading to more robust analysis and system design.
