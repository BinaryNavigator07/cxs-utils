# Core Event Schema Properties

The Semantic Event Schema defines a set of core properties that are fundamental to every event. These properties provide essential information for identifying the event, linking it to users and entities, establishing its temporality, and ensuring its uniqueness and integrity. Understanding these core fields is crucial for interpreting event data correctly and leveraging the full power of the semantic schema.

Below are the primary tables detailing these core properties.

### Core Event Identification & Details

These properties define the fundamental nature, timing, and unique identifiers of an event.

| Name             | Required | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `entity_gid`       |          | `UUID`    | The global identifier for the primary entity (e.g., Account or any sub-entity) the event is associated with. Context Suite specific.                                        |
| `timestamp`        |          | `Timestamp` | The timestamp when the event occurred, always stored in UTC. (Avro: `timestamp-micros`)                                                                                      |
| `type`             |          | `String`  | The event type (e.g., "track", "page", "identify", "group", "alias", "screen"). Originally `LowCardinality(String)`.                                                          |
| `event`            |          | `String`  | The event name, always capitalized and typically ending with a verb in the past tense (e.g., "Product Added"). Originally `LowCardinality(String)`.                             |
| `message_id`       |          | `String`  | A unique ID for each message as assigned by the client library (e.g., SDK).                                                                                                |
| `event_gid`        |          | `UUID`    | A unique Global ID (GID) for each event message, typically calculated on the server side from the `message_id` or other factors if missing.                                  |
| `root_event_gid`   |          | `UUID`    | The GID of the root event if this event is derived from another. Allows tracing event lineage. This field is optional.                                                       |
| `importance`       |          | `Integer` | The importance of the event, often on a scale (e.g., 1-5). Originally `Nullable(Int8)`. This field is optional.                                                              |
| `customer_facing`  |          | `Integer` | Indicates if the event is customer-facing (1 for true, 0 for false). Default is `0`. Originally `Int8 default 0`.                                                            |
| `local_time`       |          | `Timestamp` | The original timestamp of the event in the local time of where the event occurred. Originally `Nullable(DateTime64)`. This field is optional. (Avro: `timestamp-micros`)      |
| `integrations`     |          | `Map(String, Boolean)` | Customer-specific integration flags that override the default integrations for this event.                                                                             |
| `analyse`          |          | `Map(String, Boolean)` | Custom analysis flags that override the default analysis settings for this event.                                                                                      |

**Note on `type` vs. `event`:**
- `type` usually refers to the general category of interaction, often aligned with Segment's original event types (e.g., `track` for custom actions, `page` for page views).
- `event` provides the specific business meaning of a `track` event (e.g., "Order Completed", "Video Watched").

**Note on `message_id` vs. `event_gid`:**
- `message_id` is typically generated by the client-side SDK and ensures uniqueness from the source.
- `event_gid` is a server-side generated unique identifier, often derived from `message_id`, ensuring a consistent unique key within the data warehouse.
