### Room List Viewed Event

This event is sent when a user views a **list of available rooms** for a specific propertyâ€”typically after selecting dates, guests, and room count.
It helps track **room-level demand**, **search behavior**, and optimize **inventory visibility** based on guest filters like adults, children, and room types.
