# Application Information (`app.*` fields)

The `app.*` prefixed properties in the Semantic Event Schema are used to capture details about the client application from which an event originated. This information is particularly relevant for events generated by mobile applications (e.g., iOS or Android apps) and installable desktop applications, but can also be used for web applications if they have a defined versioning or build system.

These fields help in segmenting data, tracking versions, and diagnosing issues related to specific application releases.

## Application Properties (`app.*`)

The following table details the standard `app.*` fields. These are generally considered optional, as not all events will originate from a context where all (or any) of these application details are relevant or available.

| Property Name   | Type                | Description                                                                                                | Optional |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `app.name`      | `String (Optional)` | The name of the application (e.g., "My Awesome App", "Client Portal"). From `LowCardinality(String)`.        | Yes      |
| `app.version`   | `String (Optional)` | The version of the application (e.g., "1.2.3", "2.0-beta"). From `LowCardinality(String)`.                  | Yes      |
| `app.build`     | `String (Optional)` | The build number of the application (e.g., "101", "20230401.5"). From `LowCardinality(String)`.              | Yes      |
| `app.namespace` | `String (Optional)` | The namespace of the application, often used as a unique identifier for app stores (e.g., "com.example.myapp", "bundle.id"). From `LowCardinality(String)`. | Yes      |

## Purpose and Usage

Application information provides valuable context for events, enabling various analytical and operational use cases:

*   **Analytics & Filtering:**
    *   Segmenting event data by `app.name` to compare usage across different applications if multiple apps feed into the same analytics system.
    *   Filtering data by `app.version` or `app.build` to analyze how specific releases are performing or how user behavior changes with new versions.
*   **Version Tracking & Adoption:**
    *   Monitoring the rollout progress and adoption rate of new application versions among the user base.
    *   Understanding how quickly users are upgrading from older versions.
*   **Bug Tracking & Diagnostics:**
    *   Identifying if errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior are correlated with a particular `app.version` or `app.build`. This is crucial for developers to pinpoint and fix issues.
    *   Comparing issue rates between different app versions.
*   **Feature Flag Rollout & A/B Testing:**
    *   Correlating application version/build with feature usage, especially if new features are released progressively or tied to specific app updates.
*   **Communication & Support:**
    *   Potentially tailoring in-app messages or support interactions based on the app version a user is on.

By consistently capturing `app.*` properties, especially for mobile and desktop applications, organizations can better understand how their applications are being used, manage updates effectively, and respond more quickly to version-specific issues.
