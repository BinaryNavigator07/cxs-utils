# Event Enrichments

In the context of semantic events, **enrichments** refer to additional data, context, or insights that are programmatically added to raw events after their initial collection. The primary goal of enrichment is to enhance the value of event data by making it more understandable, actionable, and useful for analysis, operational decision-making, and automated processes.

Raw events often capture the "what" and "when" of an interaction. Enrichments add the "so what?" by providing deeper context, linking disparate pieces of information, and deriving new attributes from the existing data. A well-designed enrichment pipeline transforms a stream of basic events into a rich, intelligent data source.

## Common Types of Event Enrichments

Various automated processes and systems can contribute to enriching semantic events. Here are some common categories of enrichments:

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Events containing textual data (e.g., customer feedback, social media mentions, support tickets) can be processed to determine the sentiment expressed.
*   **Description:** Sentiment analysis typically identifies whether the text conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, and may include scores or classification of specific emotions.
*   **Schema Details:** See [Sentiment Properties](./sentiment.md) for how sentiment data is structured.

### 2. Event Classification
Events can be automatically classified based on their content or other attributes to categorize them for routing, prioritization, or analysis.
*   **Description:** This can include determining user intent, assigning issue categories, adding descriptive tags, or assessing priority.
*   **Schema Details:** Refer to [Classification Properties](./classification.md) for the schema of classification objects.

### 3. Geo-Location Enrichment
IP addresses or other location cues within an event can be used to derive more detailed geographical information.
*   **Description:** This often involves looking up an IP address to determine the city, region, and country of origin for an event, or refining provided coordinates.
*   **Schema Details:** The primary event location is detailed in [Event Location Properties](./location.md). General context like IP-derived location might also be found in [Event Context Properties](./context.md).

### 4. Entity Linking & Resolution
Events often mention entities (like users, products, or organizations) using various identifiers. Enrichment processes can resolve these to canonical entity IDs and link them formally.
*   **Description:** This involves identifying mentions of entities in event payloads and associating them with known entity records, providing a more connected view of data.
*   **Schema Details:** While specific linking metadata might be part of internal processing, resolved entity identifiers are typically found in core event fields (e.g., `user_gid`, `entity_gid`) or dedicated association structures. More on entity concepts can be found in [Understanding Entities](../../entities/index.md). (A dedicated `linking_metadata.md` might detail specific linking operation fields in the future).

### 5. Contextual Data Augmentation
Broader context about the entities involved or the circumstances of the event can be added from external or internal data sources.
*   **Description:** This could include adding details like a user's current segment, the status of a service mentioned in an event, or relevant historical patterns.
*   **Schema Details:** The [Event Context Properties](./context.md) page, particularly the `contextual_awareness` structure, details how such dynamic context can be attached.

### 6. User Agent Parsing
For events originating from web or mobile clients, the User-Agent string is parsed to extract detailed information about the device, operating system, and browser.
*   **Description:** This enrichment breaks down the User-Agent string into structured fields like device type (mobile, desktop), OS name and version (iOS, Android, Windows), browser name and version (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), and more.
*   **Schema Details:** These derived properties are often added to dedicated device, OS, or browser context objects within the event. (Detailed schema for these can be found in pages like `[Device Information](./device_info.md)`, `[OS Information](./os_info.md)`, and `[Browser Information](./browser_info.md)` - *Note: These are conceptual links; actual page names may vary or be consolidated.*)

### 7. User Trait Augmentation
Known characteristics or traits of the user involved in the event can be fetched from a user profile store and added to the event.
*   **Description:** This could include demographic information, user preferences, historical engagement metrics, or calculated scores like lifetime value.
*   **Schema Details:** User traits are typically documented in [User Profile & Traits](./traits.md).

### 8. (Internal) Analysis & Processing Metadata
Some "enrichments" are metadata about the event's journey through the data pipeline itself, including costs or details of processing by internal systems (like ML models).
*   **Description:** This might include token counts for LLM processing, scores from risk assessment models, or identifiers for the versions of models used for enrichment.
*   **Schema Details:** Such details might be found in a dedicated `analysis_metadata.md` or similar structure detailing processing attributes.

## The Value of Enriched Events

A raw event stream provides a basic record of occurrences. However, an enriched event stream offers significantly more value:

*   **Deeper Analytical Insights:** Enrichments provide more dimensions and attributes for segmentation, cohort analysis, and understanding user behavior or system performance.
*   **Enhanced Personalization:** By understanding user traits, context, and intent (often through enrichments), systems can deliver more personalized experiences.
*   **Improved Operational Efficiency:** Automated classification and sentiment analysis can help route issues, prioritize tasks, and identify urgent situations more quickly.
*   **More Intelligent Automation:** Enriched events provide the necessary signals for sophisticated automated systems, such as fraud detection, dynamic pricing, or proactive customer support.
*   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** With more context and derived insights readily available, businesses can make more informed and timely decisions.

In essence, event enrichment processes transform data into knowledge, making the entire semantic event ecosystem more powerful and valuable.
