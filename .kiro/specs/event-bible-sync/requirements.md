# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates an interactive documentation section that synchronizes semantic events from the Event Bible stored in Airtable with local documentation. The system will pull event data, vertical mappings, and classifications from three Airtable tables, then enhance the local documentation with examples and detailed descriptions. The sync process will be manual with automated documentation enhancement via Kiro triggers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to sync Event Bible data from Airtable to local documentation, so that our semantic event documentation stays current with the authoritative source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sync command is executed THEN the system SHALL fetch data from three Airtable tables (events, verticals, vertical mappings)
2. WHEN Airtable data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate the data structure and handle API errors gracefully
3. WHEN sync is complete THEN the system SHALL update local documentation files with the latest event information
4. IF API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view comprehensive event documentation with examples, so that I can understand how to implement each semantic event correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the documentation THEN each event SHALL display its classification, description, and vertical mappings
2. WHEN an event has vertical-specific names THEN the system SHALL show both the core event name and vertical-specific variants
3. WHEN viewing an event THEN the system SHALL provide implementation examples in multiple formats (JSON, Avro, Pydantic)
4. WHEN browsing events THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by vertical and event classification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want local documentation to be automatically enhanced after sync, so that examples and detailed descriptions are generated consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync completes THEN a Kiro trigger SHALL automatically enhance the documentation with examples
2. WHEN generating examples THEN the system SHALL create realistic sample data for each event type
3. WHEN enhancing documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain existing custom content while updating synced content
4. WHEN documentation is enhanced THEN the system SHALL validate that all generated examples conform to the schema

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to navigate events by vertical industry, so that I can focus on events relevant to my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the documentation THEN events SHALL be organized by vertical categories
2. WHEN selecting a vertical THEN the system SHALL display events specific to that industry with their mapped names
3. WHEN viewing vertical-specific events THEN the system SHALL show how core events are adapted for that industry
4. WHEN browsing verticals THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation between different industry contexts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Airtable API credentials securely, so that the sync process can authenticate without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN API credentials SHALL be stored in environment variables or secure configuration files
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication headers with the Airtable API key
3. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive data
4. IF credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with helpful setup instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to track sync history and changes, so that I can understand what was updated and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync is performed THEN the system SHALL log what data was updated, added, or removed
2. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report of changes made
3. WHEN viewing sync history THEN the system SHALL show timestamps and change details for previous syncs
4. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL log conflicts and resolution strategies used
