# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an interactive Event Bible that displays semantic events from Airtable in a searchable, filterable table format. Each event type will have its own detailed documentation page with comprehensive information about the event structure, usage examples, and implementation details. This will serve as the central hub for developers to discover, understand, and implement semantic events in their applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to browse all available semantic events in an interactive table, so that I can quickly discover and understand the events available for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Event Bible page THEN the system SHALL display a searchable and filterable table of semantic events
2. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter events by name, description, or category in real-time
3. WHEN a user selects a category filter THEN the system SHALL show only events matching that category
4. WHEN a user clicks on an event row THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed event documentation page
5. IF the Airtable data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with fallback content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view detailed documentation for each semantic event, so that I can understand how to properly implement it in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses an event detail page THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive event information including name, description, category, and schema
2. WHEN viewing an event detail page THEN the system SHALL show practical code examples using Jitsu integration
3. WHEN viewing an event detail page THEN the system SHALL display the complete event schema with property descriptions
4. WHEN viewing an event detail page THEN the system SHALL show related events and cross-references
5. IF an event has validation rules THEN the system SHALL display those rules clearly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to manage semantic event data through Airtable, so that I can easily update event information without requiring code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN event data is updated in Airtable THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes in the Event Bible within a reasonable time frame
2. WHEN new events are added to Airtable THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the Event Bible
3. WHEN events are marked as deprecated in Airtable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate deprecation warnings
4. IF Airtable connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to navigate seamlessly between the Event Bible and existing documentation, so that I can access all related information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Event Bible THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation links to related schema documentation
2. WHEN viewing an event detail page THEN the system SHALL include breadcrumb navigation back to the Event Bible
3. WHEN viewing existing documentation THEN the system SHALL include links to relevant Event Bible entries
4. WHEN searching the documentation THEN the system SHALL include Event Bible content in search results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Event Bible to be responsive and performant, so that I can access it efficiently on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the Event Bible on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN loading the Event Bible THEN the system SHALL display content within 3 seconds under normal conditions
3. WHEN filtering or searching events THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN the table contains many events THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
