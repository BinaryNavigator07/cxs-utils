The semantic event documentation should be structured intuitively and accessibly, potentially different from the code structure. Include jitsu-based code examples that show the most relevant data and data structures for each schema component. Do not show the output of the jitsu track function unless explicitly requested. Focus on making the documentation clear and practical for developers implementing semantic events.
